## Installation and Usage of Approved Version

To ensure you are using the reviewed and approved version of this tool, follow these installation steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [repository_url] playwright-mcp
    cd playwright-mcp
    ```
    *(Replace `[repository_url]` with the actual URL to the repository if it's hosted, or ensure you have the correct local copy.)*

2.  **Checkout the Approved Commit:**
    ```bash
    git checkout 0df6d7a441c8fedfe449c115f371e4edd411a865
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Build the Project:**
    ```bash
    npm run clean && npm run build
    ```

5.  **Configure in VS Code (or other MCP client):**
    When configuring this MCP server (e.g., in VS Code `mcp.json`), ensure you point to the local `cli.js` file within your cloned and built repository.

    Example VS Code `settings.json` configuration:
    ```json
    {
        // ... other settings ...
         "servers": {
             // ... other mcp servers ...
             "playwright": {
                 "command": "npx", // needs to be "node" on Windows machines
                 "args": [
                     "[path_to_your_cloned_repo]/playwright-mcp/cli.js"
                     // Add any other necessary arguments here, e.g., --port, --browser
                 ]
             }
         }
        // ... other settings ...
    }
    ```
    Replace `[path_to_your_cloned_repo]` with the absolute path to where you cloned the `playwright-mcp` repository. For example, if you cloned it into `/Users/yourname/projects/`, the path would be `/Users/yourname/projects/playwright-mcp/cli.js`.

 **Tips (last updated 10/14/2025):**
 1. To get to this file in VS Code, use the context menu command `> MCP: Open User Configuration`
 2. To get to this file in Cursor, use the context menu command `> View: Open MCP Settings`. Then click "New MCP Server". The top-level key is not `servers` in Cursor, but `mcpServers`.

## Notes and Considerations

*   The following security-related documents have been created:
    *   **DEPENDENCIES.md** - Documents the dependency management and update policy
    *   **SECURITY-FEATURES.md** - Documents the security features and best practices
*   The `SECURITY.md` file has been updated to include supported versions information.
*   No critical security issues were identified during this review.
