# Playwright MCP Server Go Implementation Summary

## What's Implemented

We've created a basic structure for the Go implementation of the Playwright MCP server. The following components have been implemented:

1. **Configuration Management**
   - Command-line flag parsing
   - Configuration file loading
   - Configuration merging and validation

2. **Server Structure**
   - HTTP server setup
   - Request handlers for browser management
   - Exit watchdog for graceful shutdown

3. **Browser Interfaces**
   - Browser context management
   - Tab management
   - Page snapshot handling

4. **Tool Framework**
   - Tool interface definition
   - Base tool implementation
   - Example navigate tool implementation

5. **Connection Handling**
   - MCP server implementation
   - Transport interface
   - Request handling

## What's Missing

The following components still need to be implemented:

1. **CDP Integration**
   - Actual browser launching and control using ChromeDP
   - Page interaction (navigation, clicking, typing)
   - Event handling (dialogs, file choosers)

2. **Tool Implementations**
   - Complete implementations for all tools
   - JSON schema validation for tool parameters

3. **MCP Protocol**
   - Complete implementation of the MCP protocol
   - WebSocket transport implementation
   - Proper error handling

4. **Testing**
   - Unit tests for all components
   - Integration tests for end-to-end functionality

## Next Steps

1. **CDP Integration**
   - Implement browser launching using ChromeDP
   - Implement page interaction methods
   - Handle browser events

2. **Tool Implementations**
   - Implement the remaining tools
   - Add proper JSON schema validation

3. **MCP Protocol**
   - Implement WebSocket transport
   - Complete the MCP protocol implementation

4. **Testing**
   - Add unit tests
   - Add integration tests

## Dependencies

The Go implementation uses the following key dependencies:

- **github.com/chromedp/chromedp**: For browser control via CDP
- **github.com/gorilla/websocket**: For WebSocket communication

## Design Decisions

1. **ChromeDP vs Playwright for Go**
   - We chose ChromeDP because it's a native Go implementation of the Chrome DevTools Protocol
   - It's more lightweight and has fewer dependencies than Playwright for Go

2. **Modular Architecture**
   - The code is organized into separate packages for better maintainability
   - Each component has a clear responsibility

3. **Interface-Based Design**
   - We use interfaces for browser, context, and tools to allow for easy mocking and testing
   - This also allows for different implementations (e.g., CDP vs WebDriver)
